Project completed as part of my Data Science training with Jedha Bootcamp (Paris)

# Challenge : predict conversions 🏆🏆
In this project, you will participate to a machine learning competition like the ones that are organized by https://www.kaggle.com/. You will be able to work with jupyter notebooks as usual, but in the end you'll have to submit your model's predictions to your teacher/TA, so your model's performances will be evaluated in an independent way. The scores achieved by the different teams will be stored into a leaderboard 🏅🏅

## Company's Description 📇
www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !

## Project 🚧
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the *conversions* (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the **f1-score**.

## Goals 🎯
The project can be cut into four steps :
- Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file *data_train.csv*
- Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
- Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file *data_test.csv*. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA 🤓). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
- Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?

## Deliverable 📬
To complete this project, your team should: 
- Create some relevant figures for EDA
- Train at least one model that predicts the conversions and evaluate its performances (f1, confusion matrices)
- Make at least one submission to the leaderboard 
- Analyze your best model's parameters and try to make some recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future
